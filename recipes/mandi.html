        <h2>Description</h2>
    </strong>

    <p>
        <b>Mandi</b> (Arabic: مندي) is a traditional dish that originated from Hadhramaut, Yemen consisting mainly of meat and rice with a special blend of spices, cooked in a pit underground. 
    It is extremely popular and prevalent in most areas of the <strong>Arabian Peninsula</strong>, and even considered a staple dish in many regions. 
    It is also found in Egypt, India, the Levant,<em> Hyderabad Deccan </em> and Turkey.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mandi</strong>  is usually made from rice, meat, and a mixture of spices. The meat used is usually a young and small sized lamb to enhance the taste further. 
        The main thing which differentiates mandi is that the meat is cooked in the tandoor, which is a special kind of oven. 
        The tandoor is usually a hole dug in the ground and covered inside by clay. 
        To cook mandi, dry wood is placed in the tandoor and burned to generate a lot of heat turning into charcoal. 
        Then the meat is suspended inside the tandoor without touching the charcoal. 
        <em>After that, the whole tandoor is closed without letting any of the smoke outside.</em>

    <li>Marinate chicken with all ingredients except oil and 4 tbsp mandi masala for a minimum 1-hour maximum as much as you want.</li>

        then medium flame till water dries, put on dum, sprinkle green cardamom powder and saffron on top.</li>
